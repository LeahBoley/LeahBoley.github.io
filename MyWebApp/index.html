          <h4 class="modal-title">About Info for Our Web Map App</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
          <p><strong>About the Project:</strong> This web mapping app is a solution to look at water data across time
            and space. Often, there are great data that
            are helpful and a great deal of information can be extracted from it. However, there are two issues with
            this. First, these data
            are often huge sets and difficult to understand for the normal layman. Also, geo-spatial interpretation is
            nearly impossible with a spreadsheet.
            Our web mapping app is a solution to this. We are showing some water quality and usage figures. However,
            instead of just looking at numbers, the viewer
            user can observe geographic phenomenon as well. We want this app to be simple enough for nearly anyone to
            use. It uses functions that are pretty common, but
            the information that an be viewed is extensive.
            <p>
              <p>The data we used in this map is abbreviated. When we took the raw data there were many sub categories.
                We removed several
                categories such as the details about population of counties, public supply of water to counties, and
                some categories such as
                livestock and mining. The reasoning is because figures like population were in different units than the
                water and would be
                difficult to visualize in a normalized fashion with the water units. Also, uses like livestock and
                mining are not widespread
                enough to analyze on a national level; on a state level these could be considered. As a result, we
                included commonly used
                water uses that we consider most useful to the most people, while keeping the map app reasonably easy to
                read and gain insights from.
